# RedditApp_project10

Create the reddit App using Expo (for both Android and IOS)
Group project / 4 days

## My_work
A bit everywhere again here, We needed a Auth2 using Reddit, be able to retrieve the post / the subreddits / enable a decent search bar / upvote / downvote.
The main difficulty was handling the errors between IOS and Android which cost us 1 or 2 days.

Decent work but not the best one.
